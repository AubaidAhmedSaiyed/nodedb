//! Landing one bulk-UPDATE row: the write transaction the row's body, its
//! secondary-index diff, its full-text postings and its materialized-sum
//! deltas share.
//!
//! Its own file because the transaction boundary is the concern — the bulk
//! handler decides WHICH rows change and what they become, and this decides
//! when that becomes durable. Every sparse-database write a row produces is
//! staged into the transaction opened here and lands on its commit, so a row
//! that fails at any step drops the transaction un-committed and fails the
//! statement, rather than being left with a body the index no longer
//! describes or dropped from the affected count.
//!
//! The materialized-sum fold runs inside that same transaction, one level above
//! the row's own write, so a credited target row can never survive a row whose
//! commit did not happen.

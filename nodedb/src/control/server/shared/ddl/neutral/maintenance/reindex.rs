//! `REINDEX [CONCURRENTLY] collection` — rebuild indexes.
//!
//! Grammar:
//!   REINDEX [INDEX <name>] [CONCURRENTLY] <collection>
//!
//! Both forms dispatch `MetaOp::RebuildIndex` to every core and await the
//! cross-core ACK barrier. Without `INDEX <name>` every index the
//! collection has is rebuilt: HNSW, full-text and CSR.
//!
//! Both forms rebuild the same way: off the core, with the core serving
//! reads and writes meanwhile and swapping each rebuilt index in on a later
//! tick. They differ only in when a core answers:
//!
//! - Non-concurrent: once its cutovers are done. Past the statement
//!   deadline it answers `DeadlineExceeded`; the rebuilds still complete.
//! - Concurrent: once its rebuilds have started.
//!
//! The grammar is parsed once by `nodedb_sql::ddl_ast::parse` into
//! `NodedbStatement::Reindex { .. }`; this handler receives the already-parsed
//! fields and never re-tokenises the SQL string.
